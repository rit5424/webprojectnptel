            <h3>Technology Forecasting for strategic decision making - An Introduction</h3>
            <p>How to strengthen strategic decision-making with reliable technological forecasts? Numerous quantitative methods are available for predicting future demands and short-term changes. These methods, however, have limited application for such a question. The need is to combine the advantages of qualitative methods and explorative qualitative methods for long-range technological forecasting. A structured methodology can be applied for this purpose. In this course, you will learn a combination of the technique “Extrapolation with S-curves” and a network of problems using practical case studies.</p>

                Emotional Intelligence</h3>        
            <p>“Intelligence quotient (IQ) gets you hired but emotional quotient (EQ) gets you promoted”. This popular quote by Times magazine during late nineties has made the concept of emotional intelligence more popular among people by highlighting its multiple implications and applications. The uses and utility of emotional intelligence at home, school and workplace have benefited thousands in many disciplines. This course is designed to sensitize the participants about the concept, theory and applications of emotional intelligence. The participants will get to know the added advantage of EQ the software of the brain over the hardware (EQ). This programme will also explore how our hearts rule over our heads for creative creation. It will also focus on how various principles of emotional intelligence guide us in different contexts of life. The awareness about the credo of emotional intelligence will develop insights into self-regulation and realization of one’s optimum potentials for better performance. The participants will come to know about many unknowns of life, which will further help them to enhance their awareness to be effective on their roles. The course will offer useful lessons with the help of practical exercises, games, audio-visual instruments, case studies, classroom interaction to show the road map how to foster emotional intelligence in organisation for achieving health, happiness and optimal performance at work.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Hacking</h3>
            <p>Ethical hacking is a subject that has become very important in present-day context, and can help individuals and organizations to adopt safe practices and usage of their IT infrastructure. Starting from the basic topics like networking, network security and cryptography, the course will cover various attacks and vulnerabilities and ways to secure them. There will be hands-on demonstrations that will be helpful to the participants. The participants are encouraged to try and replicate the demonstration experiments that will be discussed as part of the course.</p>

            <h3>User-centric Computing for Human-Computer Interaction</h3>
            <p>Human-computer interaction is an emerging field of study at present, due to the proliferation of large number of consumer electronic products. The key issue in this field is to make the products usable to lay-persons. In order to do that, we need to take care of the (creative) design aspects (the look-and-feel of the interface) and also the system design aspect (both software and hardware). The field is interdisciplinary with inputs required from various other fields. However, the computer science and engineering plays the central role in the design of such systems (as per SIGCHI of ACM). In this course, we will introduce the engineering and computational issues in the design of human-computer interfaces for laypersons. The topics covered in the course includes the engineering life cycles for design of interactive systems, computational design framework (as part of the life cycle), components of the framework including the computational models of users and systems, and evaluation of such systems (with or without users).

            <h3>Privacy and Security in Online Social Media</h3>
            <p>With increase in the usage of the Internet, there has been an exponential increase in the use of online social media and networks on the Internet. Websites like Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, Google+, FourSquare, Pinterest, Tinder, and the likes have changed the way the Internet is being used. However, widely used, there is a lack of understanding of privacy and security issues on online social media. Privacy and security of online social media need to be investigated, studied and characterized from various perspectives (computational, cultural, psychological, etc.). Student completing the course will be able to appreciate various privacy and security concerns (spam, phishing, fraud nodes, identity theft) on Online Social Media and Student will be able to clearly articulate one or two concerns comprehensively on one Online Social Media, this will be achieved by homework. </p>
